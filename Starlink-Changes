#  Add all changes to standard distribution to this file.

 - latex2html: undef(item1,item2...) expanded to undef item1; undef
               item2; etc. whereever it occurs.

 - latex2html: kill added to write_string_out to stop forked process
               problems on Linux.

 - latex2html: removal of newlines spaces and tabs in labels added to 
               anchor_label. This is needed for "sst_routine" xlabels
               to work.
 
 - latex2html, texexpand, pstoimg, install-test, makemap & 
   configure-pstoimg:
                     added:
                        : # *-*-perl-*-*
                          eval 'exec perl -S  $0 "$@"'
                          if $running_under_some_shell;
                     to avoid need for #!/path/perl statement.

 - mk: created to control install/deinstall process.

 - latex2html: problem with renewcommand substitution in 
               "sub process_cmd" fixed. 

 - latex2html: error message in "sub wrap_raw_arg_cmds" suppressed.
               This is caused by missing wrap command (which is
               defined in a forked process).

 - latex2html: Removed trailing space\tab slurp in pre_process for
               comments. This eats into next line unsetting formatting
               to next comments, i.e.: 

    # begin{verbatim}
    #   % lpr
    #   % lpq
    # end{verbatim}

    Looks like:

    #   % lpr
    # % lpq

    Instead of:
    #   % lpr
    #   % lpq
